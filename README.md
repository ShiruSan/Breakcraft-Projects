# Breakraft Projects

This project contains all plugins of the Breakcraft Minecraft Network, which was shutdown in April 2021 due to low player count and high maintenance.
None of the project have a good configuration as they're old and made by an 14-year-old young boy with the dream of having a successful minecraft server. Now after more than 2 years since the server is shutdown I came to the conclusion to open-source all projects used in that time including:<br>
## All spigot plugins created
- Bungeecord Plugin
- Lobby Plugin
- Survival Plugin
- Challenges Plugin
- Citybuild Plugin (never completed)

## Other projects
- Breakcraft Discord Bot

## What happens now ?
All projects are now open to the world but are broken, so if you just want to see the source and have no headaches trying to import these go ahead.
For everyone trying to use these projects for their servers just **don't** as they use old dependencies, and it's more worth rewrite it than copy and paste, but it's your decision.
I'm going to have a restart in the spigot development so maybe one day I will update these projects they're here for everyone, so have fun or headaches.
